# p2p-blocklist-bulk-downloader
A bash script that fetches all the bluetack iblocklist lists (including premium -- generous of them) , using curl, decompressing, and renaming the raw .p2p lists in an easy simple way.
Also, I will try to keep an up-to-date mirror of these and other blocklists at http://sp33dk1ngp1n.com/d
